Hot Cross Bun Reviews

<!--more-->

March Thread: Hot Cross Buns.

## Coupland's

Coupland's Bakeries Hot Cross Buns Traditional.\
Ellerslie Four Square \$3.80\
Fruit, texture, spice, all very good. One half in the microwave, one not, both were good with marge. A very good start to the month. I'm not sure where to start with scoring so I'll say 3 or 4 out of 5.

## New World

New World generic, \$3.99, includes 2 free.

Crosses look good. Standard raisins and spice. They seem a little over mixed though. Texture is tough. Adequate. 2/5.

## Countdown Loaf

Countdown Traditional Hot Cross Loaf. 1/6 for concept, because there should be a half dozen. 0 for loaves purchased.

## Countdown Novelty

Countdown Apple and Spice + Chocolate and Orange. 9 for \$3. I'm sure they're great, but when Countdown also has traditional and fruitless, I don't need anymore from there.

## Countdown Chocolate

Countdown Chocolate Hot Cross Buns. 2 for \$6.\
The chocolate pieces melt nicely, but the bun itself is only a little bit chocolate. Fruit buns can be denser while still being nice. I think the bun makers at countdown went for a lighter note. I would however very much enjoy a Hot Cross Brownie. Maybe not in a pack of 6 though. 3/5 would eat again.

## Countdown Fruitless

I'm sure I posted about Countdown Fruitless Hot Cross Buns but it seems to have disappeared. It doesn't matter much. They're pointless. They're nice, but they're pointless.

## Countdown Traditional

Countdown Traditional Hot Cross Buns. 2 for \$6, because of course they are. These ones have raisins and currants but not peel. I like something a little extra. Better texture than New World. 3/5, same as the whole Countdown range.
