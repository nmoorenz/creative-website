<p>Hot Cross Bun Reviews</p>
<!--more-->
<p>March Thread: Hot Cross Buns.</p>
<div id="couplands" class="section level2">
<h2>Coupland’s</h2>
<p>Coupland’s Bakeries Hot Cross Buns Traditional.<br />
Ellerslie Four Square $3.80<br />
Fruit, texture, spice, all very good. One half in the microwave, one not, both were good with marge. A very good start to the month. I’m not sure where to start with scoring so I’ll say 3 or 4 out of 5.</p>

<div id="new-world" class="section level2">
<h2>New World</h2>
<p>New World generic, $3.99, includes 2 free.</p>
<p>Crosses look good. Standard raisins and spice. They seem a little over mixed though. Texture is tough. Adequate. 2/5.</p>

<div id="countdown-loaf" class="section level2">
<h2>Countdown Loaf</h2>
<p>Countdown Traditional Hot Cross Loaf. 1/6 for concept, because there should be a half dozen. 0 for loaves purchased.</p>

</div>
<div id="countdown-novelty" class="section level2">
<h2>Countdown Novelty</h2>
<p>Countdown Apple and Spice + Chocolate and Orange. 9 for $3. I’m sure they’re great, but when Countdown also has traditional and fruitless, I don’t need anymore from there.</p>

</div>
<div id="countdown-chocolate" class="section level2">
<h2>Countdown Chocolate</h2>
<p>Countdown Chocolate Hot Cross Buns. 2 for $6.<br />
The chocolate pieces melt nicely, but the bun itself is only a little bit chocolate. Fruit buns can be denser while still being nice. I think the bun makers at countdown went for a lighter note. I would however very much enjoy a Hot Cross Brownie. Maybe not in a pack of 6 though. 3/5 would eat again.</p>

<div id="countdown-fruitless" class="section level2">
<h2>Countdown Fruitless</h2>
<p>I’m sure I posted about Countdown Fruitless Hot Cross Buns but it seems to have disappeared. It doesn’t matter much. They’re pointless. They’re nice, but they’re pointless.</p>
</div>
<div id="countdown-traditional" class="section level2">
<h2>Countdown Traditional</h2>
<p>Countdown Traditional Hot Cross Buns. 2 for $6, because of course they are. These ones have raisins and currants but not peel. I like something a little extra. Better texture than New World. 3/5, same as the whole Countdown range.</p>
