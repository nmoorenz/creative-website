<p>This is a copy of my 2022 facebook thread on hot cross buns</p>
<p><strong>Countdown Chocolate Orange</strong><br />
These folks have a whole range out now which reminded me to post. These were released first I think since I haven’t seen the others. Countdown knows where to direct their advertising. Quite good, like a bun of jaffas? Maybe a bit generic? $6.50 for countdown half dozen?<br />
3/5 room for improvement</p>

<p><strong>Yarrows The Bakers</strong>
Apple and Cinnamon Buns<br />
“Soft sweet buns with juicy apple pieces and sweetly spiced cinnamon”. Delicious, worth a second purchase to confirm that they are delicious.<br />
4/5 the best a man can get</p>
<p>Sam seems like a good person<br />

<p>I’m glad I’m not mistaken with countdown hot cross buns.<br />

<p><strong>Countdown</strong>, the usual, quite good, balanced, crisp up well under the grill.<br />
3.5/5 reliable</p>

<p><strong>Bakers Delight</strong>, half dozen for $10.<br />
These are large and dense soft, and crisp up well on the oven on the third day. We left the butter out overnight and it was worth it.<br />
4.5/5 scrumptious</p>

<p><strong>Cookie Time</strong><br />
My only beef with these is that they say “rustic” as if breaking apart some biscuits and chocolate instead of nicely cutting is a selling point. Otherwise: delicious, moreish, chocolatey, extravagant.<br />
I’m a sucker for marketing crossover, I even liked the Kit Kat Whitakers chocolate, so the best cookies with the best buns is an obvious yes<br />
5/5 ate 3 in one day and wanted more</p>
