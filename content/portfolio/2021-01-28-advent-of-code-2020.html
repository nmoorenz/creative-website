<p>This is a short review of my first foray into Advent of Code. I’ve started to gather my thoughts in the github readme while looking over the code again. I had big goals of completing each day in R and python, but after a few days decided that one language was more than enough. It will be an ongoing project to look at each day and see if I can write python solutions, while also collecting choice tidbits of fancy or useful or awful code.</p>
<p>This is the advent website: <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2020">Advent of Code 2020</a></p>
<p>This is my github repository: <a href="https://github.com/nmoorenz/advent-of-code">github.com/nmoorenz/advent-of-code</a></p>
<p>The following is a comparison of R and Python code for day 5, my favourite day of the challenge. Recognising the ticket numbers can be interpreted in binary is a crucial breakthrough. I love finding a new and good function in R: <code>strtoi()</code>. That takes a <code>base</code> argument for binary! Then finding <code>int()</code> in Python has the same argument. List comprehensions are, for me, a killer feature of Python.</p>

<h3>R Code</h3>
<pre class="r"><code># tidyverse of course
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))

# love the here package to load things
inputfile = here::here(&quot;static&quot;, &quot;data&quot;, &quot;advent2020&quot;, &quot;day05.txt&quot;)
bp &lt;- read.delim(inputfile, header = FALSE)

# conversions for letters to binary
named_v = c(&quot;F&quot; = &quot;0&quot;, &quot;B&quot; = &quot;1&quot;, &quot;L&quot; = &quot;0&quot;, &quot;R&quot; = &quot;1&quot;)

# mutate seems like the best way to do this
# we can also use many replacements in one function
# strtoi() for string to integer, in base 2
bp_bin &lt;- bp %&gt;% 
  mutate(
    bin = str_replace_all(V1, named_v),
    row = strtoi(str_sub(bin, end = 7), base = 2), 
    col = strtoi(str_sub(bin, start = 8), base = 2), 
    id = row * 8 + col
  )

# max is part one answer
max_id &lt;- max(bp_bin$id)  
min_id &lt;- min(bp_bin$id)

# possible seats from min to max
bp_seq = seq(from = min_id, to = max_id)

# part two answer - seat left over
p2 &lt;- setdiff(bp_seq, bp_bin$id)</code></pre>

<h3>Python Code</h3>
<pre class="python"><code># read file
with open(&quot;../../static/data/advent2020/day05.txt&quot;, &quot;r&quot;) as f:
  bp = f.read().splitlines()

# row and col binary via replacement
row = [x[:7].replace(&quot;B&quot;, &quot;1&quot;).replace(&quot;F&quot;, &quot;0&quot;) for x in bp]
col = [x[7:].replace(&quot;L&quot;, &quot;0&quot;).replace(&quot;R&quot;, &quot;1&quot;) for x in bp]

# id as a combo of row and col            
id = [int(r, 2) * 8 + int(c, 2) for r, c in zip(row, col)]

#part a

# part b
p2 = set(range(min(id), max(id))) - set(id)</code></pre>

<h3>Answer</h3>
<p>The maximum seat number on my plane (part one answer) is 826 and my seat number (part two answer) is 678.</p>
<p>In honour of the card playing crab mentioned in the challenges, here’s a big one from the Te Papa collection, mainly for creating a picture for the blog main page.</p>
