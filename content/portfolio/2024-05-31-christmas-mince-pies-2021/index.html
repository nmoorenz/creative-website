<p>Christmas mince pies, 2021.</p>
<p><strong>Countdown Salted Caramel Tarts</strong><br />
A twist on the regular. Quite nice, not at all traditional. Filling did not fill the case.<br />
Average 3/5</p>
<p><img src="/img/fb21xmas/cd-salted-caramel.jpg" /></p>
<p>Didnâ€™t really fill the case after the top rose. Inadequate</p>

<p>Extra cases - I donâ€™t need 5, thanks though</p>

<p><strong>Countdown Plum and Gin</strong><br />
These are great. No gin taste but it is fun to pretend Iâ€™m having a tipple for morning tea. The plum is excellent. Something went on during baking, all the ones in the store were bubbled over as well.<br />
4/5 gotta look your best</p>

<p><strong>New World Xmas Mince Tarts</strong><br />
How good do these look? The ribbon ðŸŽ€ really makes these stand out. Itâ€™s reusable as well with a little untie. Christmas wrapping totally sorted. Icing sugar sprinkled on top too which is a luxury. Good tarts, similar to others, which I do enjoy.<br />
5/5 gotta look your best</p>

<p>New World also have these in silver and gold, in case youâ€™re looking for some colour coordination for the Christmas table</p>

<p><strong>Edmonds Apricot and Cardamom Spiced Tarts</strong><br />
These were surprisingly good. Well presented in the usual Edmonds box. No foil case, so they must have a premium production line to get them out of the trays safely. Filling flavours were perfectly complimentary, pastry well baked.<br />
5/5 the score might be generous but worth your time</p>

<p><strong>Countdown Traditional FRUIT Mince Pies</strong><br />
New packaging, I think. They might have changed up the filling recipe slightly? There was a little more bite in the fruit.<br />
4/5 consistency is good</p>

<p><strong>Countdown Rum Infused Tarts</strong><br />
These are good. Similar to the gin ones, a little filling escaped during baking. Just a hint of rum spice with the traditional fruit mince. Has the price been reduced? Donâ€™t be scared folks.<br />
4/5 dealz</p>

<p><strong>Katie Moore Homemade Mince Pies</strong><br />
Sultanas, green apple, orange peel, brandy, no figs this year. Great by themselves or with ice cream.<br />
5/5 great to spend time with family at Christmas</p>
