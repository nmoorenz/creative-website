Christmas Fruit Mince Pie Review

## New World

New World Christmas Mince Tarts 6pk. Crust: plain, soft underneath and a little crisp around the outside. Filling: sweet, no spice. Ratio (crust to filling): good. Other: no foil 3/5 would eat again

## Aunt Betty

Aunt Betty's Christmas Fruit Mince Tarts, $4 from The Warehouse
Crust: crumbly when cutting for this excellent food photography. More like a shortbread taste and texture.
Filling: sweetness and spice, better than New World
Ratio: solid top with a nice star pattern means too much crust.
Score: 2/5 would eat again

## Countdown

Countdown Traditional Fruit Mince Pies, 2 packs for $6.
Lattice top, with a little overhang to nibble on before taking it out of the foil.
Good flavour and texture for filling.
Ratio is good.
Sweetness, which I like.
4/5, I already knew these are my favourite. Taking recommendations for anything better.
