<p>I always get confused by this.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I often move between work computer and home computer, and pick up work on a repository after months or even years of not doing anything with it. I recently did this with a few repositories to fix them up. I also moved jobs last year. So, I have a new work computer but want to commit with my personal email address, not my work address, and I had not updated the local user.email for one of the old repos.</p>
<p>These are my notes so I don’t have to go searching through StackOverflow every time.</p>
<p>An additional weird problem I just found is that I use the same profile picture for most things so I can’t quickly tell the difference between commits on GitHub. Slowly scrolling, then… Scrolling through <code>git log</code>… I could probably find a command for showing commit information on one line… Anyway.</p>
<p>To find current configuration</p>
<pre><code>git config --list</code></pre>
<p>and specifically for email address</p>
<pre><code>git config user.email</code></pre>
<p>I don’t want to change the email address globally for this computer, I just want to change for the repository i.e. locally.</p>
<pre><code>git config --local user.email &quot;your_email@abc.example&quot;</code></pre>

<p>Now, I want to change previous commits, specifically their email address.</p>
<p>This looks like what I want:<br />

<pre><code>git rebase -r &lt;some commit before all of your bad commits&gt; \
    --exec &#39;git commit --amend --no-edit --reset-author&#39;</code></pre>
<p>Except, this is not what I want, because I don’t really want to change all of the metadata. This changes the dates and times of old commits, which I don’t really want to do.</p>
<p>I also don’t know how to get rid of what I’ve just done, since <code>git pull</code> does a merge into the main branch. I have deleted the local repo and cloned the GitHub copy into the same place. Drastic! It’s quick though.</p>
<p>Notes: it looks like filter-branch is not a good idea; I am not worried about force pushing or for others to use my work, it’s only me using a private repo; I would like to keep the dates of old commits even though it doesn’t actually matter; I don’t have any tags on commits; I don’t want to filter certain email addresses, I just want all the same email address.</p>
<p>This answer will work for the latest commit only, after changing the user name and email.</p>
<pre><code>git commit --amend --reset-author --no-edit </code></pre>
<p>Then this answer shows up, way down the list<br />
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/75841127" class="uri">https://stackoverflow.com/a/75841127</a></p>
<pre><code>git commit --amend --author &#39;My Name &lt;email@example.com&gt;&#39; --no-edit </code></pre>
<p>And this is what we want! Glorious.</p>
<pre><code>git rebase -r &lt;commit/branch before wrong author and email or &#39;--root&#39; for all commits&gt; --exec &quot;git commit --amend --no-edit --author &#39;My Name &lt;email@example.com&gt;&#39;&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Then to get those changes back to a remote repository, <code>-f</code> to force</p>
<pre><code>git push -f</code></pre>
<p>Thanks for listening.</p>
