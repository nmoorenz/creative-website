<div id="yarrows" class="section level2">
<h2>Yarrows</h2>
<p>Yarrows The Bakers<br />
Spiced Fruit Easter Buns<br />
Surprisingly weird name even though it makes total sense. They come with instructions on heating: 3-5 mins at 180C. Delicious, toasty, crunchy, fruity.<br />
4/5 looking forward to more buns</p>
