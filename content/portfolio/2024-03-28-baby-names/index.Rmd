```{r load}
library(here)
library(dplyr)

names = read.csv(here('static', 'data', 'baby-names-2024-01-08.csv'))

names = names |> 
    group_by(Year, Sex) |> 
    mutate(rank = rank(-Count, ties.method = 'first'))
```

Questions about the data: have names become more spread out over time? I should check the percentage of the top ten out of the whole, and how many names are in the list at all. I think this is only for a count of more than ten per year, that messes with proper percentages but is representative. 

A ranking chart to show popularity has changed over time would be interesting: any names that were number one at any time, show them up and down in the top 100. 

Are there differences between boys and girls? Popularity, names that occur in both lists, how high do they get?
