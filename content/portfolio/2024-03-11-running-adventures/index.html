<p>These are not my running adventures.</p>

<div id="barkley" class="section level3">
<h3>Barkley</h3>
<p>I don’t know how I first became interested in the Barkley Marathon. It’s a fascinating race in the Appalchian mountains with a secret entry process, a quirky race director, and unknown route. It’s happening again soon for 2024, but no one apart from those organising and taking part know when it’s going to happen.</p>
<p>After a quick search to find different videos, run247 has a number of recent articles giving background and a <a href="https://run247.com/race-previews/barkley-marathons-2024-how-to-follow-live-tracking-latest-results">preview of 2024</a>. There are plenty of onward links from that article. There’s also <a href="https://run247.com/running-news/trail/barkley-marathons-best-documentaries">this list</a> of documentaries, which are fascinating insights in to the toil and likely failure of a nearly impossible race. “The Race That Eats Its Young” and “Where Dreams Go To Die” are apt titles for these captures of human <del>suffering</del> endeavour.</p>
<p>An aside, that I found while looking for Barkley documentaries, linked to from the run247 posts: John Kelly (two time finisher of the Barkley) has a great blog with info on <a href="https://randomforestrunner.com/2017/05/how-to-apply-to-barkley/">Hot to apply to Barkley</a> and <a href="https://randomforestrunner.com/2024/02/how-to-get-in-to-the-barkley-marathons/">How to get in to Barkley</a>. He also has a post on the <a href="https://randomforestrunner.com/2020/08/the-grand-round-2020/">Grand Round</a> which is a nice segway into the next link.</p>

<h3>Bob Graham</h3>
<p>As a result of watching lots of ultramarathon videos on youtube I got recommended this video from Canadian Jeff Pelletier doing the Bob Graham Round. I really enjoyed it so wanted to include it here.</p>
{{% youtube "dOTPAayi4nM" %}}
<p>First run by Bob Graham in 1932 (aged 42), the 42 peaks of the round need to be visited within 24 hours. There is now a whole community and <a href="http://bobgrahamclub.org.uk/">website</a> and awards dinner (!!) every year.</p>

<div id="ireland" class="section level3">
<h3>Ireland</h3>
<p>That brings me to the next part of my post. Again, I think I just stumbled across these one day. There are two rounds in Ireland, one older and one newer.</p>
<p>Wicklow is older, having been run since 2009. <a href="https://www.imra.ie/rounds/view/id/1" class="uri">https://www.imra.ie/rounds/view/id/1</a> gives course information, completed rounds, rules, and records. With the help of <a href="https://irish.gridreferencefinder.com/">Grid Reference Finder</a> I created a <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1QgIPBX262RkN0iKXeV2Aqll-1DIssW8&amp;usp=sharing">google maps route</a>, in the vague hope that I might one day be able to even think about completing the challenge.</p>
<p>There’s also the Connemara round: <a href="https://www.imra.ie/rounds/view/id/2" class="uri">https://www.imra.ie/rounds/view/id/2</a> has only one completion, in 2023! Again, I created a <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1oBqP3bHHey8xyuYKDXuy7nlUo7RUdSc&amp;usp=sharing">google maps route</a>. This is a wonderful part of Ireland that I have been to but not explored enough.</p>
<p>And just for good measure, I created an <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1UaMIiIh9aCgrUMvyGIXSGidaEJDkqK8&amp;usp=sharing">Auckland Volcano Round</a>. Future task: create a script to find the shortest route between a selection of the volcanos in a Travelling Salesperson fashion.</p>
<p>All this is to say, I love the idea of these runs, it is two and a half years until I am 42, and maybe I should do something about putting these dreams into reality.</p>

<h3>2024 Barkley</h3>
<p>Update: the 2024 Barkley Marathon had five finishers, including the first woman, Jasmin Paris.</p>
<p>Here are a bunch of links with results:</p>
