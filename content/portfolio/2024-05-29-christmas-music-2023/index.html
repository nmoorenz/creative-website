<p>Some recommendations for alternative Christmas music</p>
<p>Bad Religion: Christmas Songs<br />
This is really fun, starting with an acapella bit and racing through a bunch of songs about the “reason for the season”.<br />

<p>The Toasters: Christma-Ska<br />
Some covers and some originals, this is also a super fun Christmas album. Highlights: Winter Wonderland and War is Over<br />

<p>Reel Big Fish: Happy Skalidays<br />
Skanking, a joke song, Little Drummer Boy (which has been on all 3 albums so far), an inclusive song, another joke song, and Auld Lang Syne. I love RBF.<br />

<p>The Reverend Horton Heat: We Three Kings<br />
Psychobilly might sound intimidating but this album is really accessible and familiar. Highly recommended!<br />

<p>Goldfinger: The Goldfinger Christmas EP<br />
4 classics in less than ten minutes. You always put the emphasis on “five gold rings” right? Not like this.<br />

<p>MU330: Winter Wonderland<br />
My particular favourite off this album is “I Got This Neighbour”. Sweet sweet late 90s ska-punk.<br />

<p>MXPX: Punk Rawk Christmas<br />
Another EP from a band putting out a Christmas album 20 years after they were at their peak? I don’t care if it’s a cliche, I like it<br />

<p>Christmas with Weezer<br />
Pretty typical Weezer sound, but they don’t really do anything interesting here. Just going through the motions with a bunch of Christmas songs. Not recommended unless you really love Rivers<br />

<p>Barenaked for the Holidays<br />
This is great. Worker solidarity with the elves, interesting interpretations of classics, some Hanukkah songs, and the highlight for me is “Santa Sabbath”. Great fun<br />
