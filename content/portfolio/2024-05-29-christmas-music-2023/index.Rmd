Some recommendations for alternative Christmas music

**Bad Religion: Christmas Songs**        
This is really fun, starting with an acapella bit and racing through a bunch of songs about the "reason for the season".

**The Toasters: Christma-Ska**        
Some covers and some originals, this is also a super fun Christmas album. Highlights: Winter Wonderland and War is Over         
https://open.spotify.com/album/01WaNurRP5USodwR1m67tU

**Reel Big Fish: Happy Skalidays**        
Skanking, a joke song, Little Drummer Boy (which has been on all 3 albums so far), an inclusive song, another joke song, and Auld Lang Syne. I love RBF.

**The Reverend Horton Heat: We Three Kings**         
Psychobilly might sound intimidating but this album is really accessible and familiar. Highly recommended!

**Goldfinger: The Goldfinger Christmas EP**         
4 classics in less than ten minutes. You always put the emphasis on "five gold rings" right? Not like this.

**MU330: Winter Wonderland**        
My particular favourite off this album is "I Got This Neighbour". Sweet sweet late 90s ska-punk.

**MXPX: Punk Rawk Christmas**        
Another EP from a band putting out a Christmas album 20 years after they were at their peak? I don't care if it's a cliche, I like it

**Christmas with Weezer**       
Pretty typical Weezer sound, but they don't really do anything interesting here. Just going through the motions with a bunch of Christmas songs. Not recommended unless you really love Rivers

**Barenaked for the Holidays**         
This is great. Worker solidarity with the elves, interesting interpretations of classics, some Hanukkah songs, and the highlight for me is "Santa Sabbath". Great fun
