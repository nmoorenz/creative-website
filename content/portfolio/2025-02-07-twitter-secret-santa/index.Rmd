Twitter Secret Santa

<!--more-->

This is the amazing gift I got from Twitter Secret Santa in 2020

Postage Stamps 1985-1989 'Native Birds'

Handstitched to vintage linen, mounted on harakeke paper and bordered with rauru.

"I make the paper and rauru from a flax bush in my garden. The linen came from my great grandmother. Every work I make is individual."
