<strong>Garvey’s Bakery</strong> mini mince pies 7pk
Icing sugar topping, a little bit wholemeal crust, not so full with the filling, but they’re not even mini. 5/5 everything is delicious</p>

<p><strong>Garvey’s Bakery</strong> Mince Pies, 6 for €5
No nonsense name, that’s for sure. Sugar coating on top! Not structurally sound, the top was thicker than the rest of the case. Full of filling, full of flavour. 5/5 everything is delicious</p>

<p><strong>Mr Kipling</strong>
Exceedingly Good Cakes
6 Deep Filled Mince Pies
I can’t speak for Mr Kipling’s other cakes but these are good enough. It seems like Irish mince pie pastry isn’t blanched like NZ and it’s better for it. Tasty filling, nice design on top. 5/5 everything is delicious</p>
