<h2>Countdown</h2>
<p>Countdown Fruit Mince Pies</p>
<p>A classic, but kinda basic. The tin foil seems unnecessary, just cook them in a muffin pan. (How big do commercial muffin pans get or do they just have lots of them?) 3/5 good in a pinch but not top shelf</p>

<div id="homemade-1" class="section level2">
<h2>Homemade 1</h2>
<p>Homemade by my niece. Pastry and filling shop bought, but expertly put together as a practice before Christmas Day. More currants and spice than other pies which is good. Baked well, eaten hot, delicious. 4/5 looking forward to round 2</p>

<div id="free-stuff" class="section level2">
<h2>Free Stuff</h2>
<p>Free mince pie as part of a corporate thank you for IT from Spark at work. Fruit mince was really minced, smooth, different but ok. Case was nice. 3/5 tastes like free stuff</p>

<div id="homemade-2" class="section level2">
<h2>Homemade 2</h2>
<p>Homemade from scratch by my sister. Sultanas, figs, cranberries, apple, orange and lemon zest, mixed peel, brandy and butter. Delicious. Can taste the different fruit. 7/5 perfect score now I’ve got 2 people making pies.</p>

<div id="homemade-3" class="section level2">
<h2>Homemade 3</h2>
<p>(catching up on a few pies)</p>
<p>Farewell morning tea homemade. Pretty good, thick pastry, standard mince, 3/5 tastes like goodbye</p>

<div id="two-tarts" class="section level2">
<h2>Two Tarts</h2>
<p>Two Tarts brandy flavour from Parnell farmers’ market. They also had original and Cointreau. Didn’t really taste the brandy, but still good. Two bites and done. 3/5 prefer the potato farl we also got from the markets</p>

</div>
<div id="pams" class="section level2">
<h2>Pams</h2>
<p>Pam’s fruit mince tarts. Standard pattern for fruit mince pies apparently, as evidenced by countdown and Ernest Adams (up next) and some others I’ve seen. Maybe a little less butter than Ernest Adams, but very similar. 3/5 reasonable</p>

<div id="ernest-adams" class="section level2">
<h2>Ernest Adams</h2>
<p>Ernest Adams Christmas Delights</p>
<p>Festive Rich Fruit Christmas Tarts</p>
<p>Bold packaging can’t save these tarts from same-same mediocrity. 3/5 maybe I should make my own or maybe I should not post all at once</p>
