Christmas beer sampler, 2019

<!--more-->

*Christmas beer sampler, 2019*

**Day 1:** Big Pigeon Pilsner 5.0% AIBA Gold 2016. Clean and crisp, goes well with stir-fry that had too much chilli. Solid start to the calendar.

**Day 2:** Great Justice Coconut Porter Didn't get much coconut from this but a good porter. Not the best match for fish and chips but I have to respect the advent order.

**Day 3:** Shepherd's Ale

Good red ale, malty and oaty. 2.5% don't wanna get outta control on a Saturday night.

**Day 4:** Karengose Salty Seaweed Ale Karengo is a type of seaweed, and gose is a type of beer brewed with salty water. The things you learn. Not too salty, a little sour. Good.

**Day 7:** Chocolate Cherry Porter Not so much of a cherry taste, and I saw cherries at the supermarket and they are very expensive, so I can't understand if they don't use many cherries
