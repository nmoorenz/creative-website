## Wild Wheat

I got given some fancy mince pies from Wild Wheat so I'm starting early. These are delicious, just right crumbly crust, fruity and spicy filling. No idea how much they cost though. 4/5 open to receiving more donations.

## PaknSave

Pak'n'Save 9 for cheap, with proper Irish tea, delicious and gone too soon. 3/5 excellent while organising Christmas dinner with the in-laws.

## Yarrows

Yarrow's, home town mini pies. Not pretty, quite tasty.
