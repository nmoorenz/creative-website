Hi! I'm Nathan, I like frisbees and dinosaurs and am strangely fond of spreadsheets. This blog is an attempt to share what I know and what I like. At some stage I might post a CV here: on my list of things to do is create a markdown/pagedown version of my resume. Also on this list is some #rtistry with no small help from the internet.
