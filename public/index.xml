      <description>Some recommendations for alternative Christmas music&#xA;Bad Religion: Christmas Songs&#xA;This is really fun, starting with an acapella bit and racing through a bunch of songs about the “reason for the season”.&#xA;https://open.spotify.com/album/6C89e7cpRmYu1SSKK3GcwS&#xA;https://www.kerrang.com/a-love-letter-to-bad-religions-christmas-songs&#xA;The Toasters: Christma-Ska&#xA;Some covers and some originals, this is also a super fun Christmas album. Highlights: Winter Wonderland and War is Over&#xA;https://open.spotify.com/album/01WaNurRP5USodwR1m67tU&#xA;Reel Big Fish: Happy Skalidays&#xA;Skanking, a joke song, Little Drummer Boy (which has been on all 3 albums so far), an inclusive song, another joke song, and Auld Lang Syne.</description>

      <description>This is a copy of my 2024 hot cross bun review thread from Facebook&#xA;Whittaker’s Hot Cross Bun Chocolate&#xD;Apparently I have a reputation: I’ve already had two of these blocks of Hot Cross Bun chocolate from Whittaker’s bought for me. It’s quite good at what it’s trying to do, with spice and orange and fruit, but it could never be better than berry and biscuit or Ghana peppermint. 7.</description>

      <description>&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have known about the concept of a “Third Place” for some time, but “Non-Places” are new to me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When Wordle first went viral I was in a group chat at work and had the idea of making a Python tutorial based on Wordle. I never did it, but this post is that introduction. I will likely do another introduction to R post as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Advent of Code 2020</title>
      <link>https://nmoore.nz/portfolio/2021-01-28-advent-of-code-2020/</link>

      <description>This is a short review of my first foray into Advent of Code. I’ve started to gather my thoughts in the github readme while looking over the code again. I had big goals of completing each day in R and python, but after a few days decided that one language was more than enough. It will be an ongoing project to look at each day and see if I can write python solutions, while also collecting choice tidbits of fancy or useful or awful code.</description>

      <description>I’m a big fan of Run the Jewels, and remixes, and brass, and shortcodes, and this gets it exactly right.</description>
