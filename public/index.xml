      <description>This is a copy of my hot cross bun review thread from Facebook
Whittaker’s Hot Cross Bun ChocolateApparently I have a reputation: I’ve already had two of these blocks of Hot Cross Bun chocolate from Whittaker’s bought for me. It’s quite good at what it’s trying to do, with spice and orange and fruit, but it could never be better than berry and biscuit or Ghana peppermint. 7.5/10</description>

&lt;p&gt;I have known about the concept of a “Third Place” for some time, but “Non-Places” are new to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Wordle first went viral I was in a group chat at work and had the idea of making a Python tutorial based on Wordle. I never did it, but this post is that introduction. I will likely do another introduction to R post as well.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Advent of Code 2020</title>

      <description>This is a short review of my first foray into Advent of Code. I’ve started to gather my thoughts in the github readme while looking over the code again. I had big goals of completing each day in R and python, but after a few days decided that one language was more than enough. It will be an ongoing project to look at each day and see if I can write python solutions, while also collecting choice tidbits of fancy or useful or awful code.</description>

      <description>I’m a big fan of Run the Jewels, and remixes, and brass, and shortcodes, and this gets it exactly right.
