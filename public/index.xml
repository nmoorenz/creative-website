      <description>It’s been some years since I’ve updated my personal website so I though I better do something about it.&#xA;The first step was to change the theme. This can be done in place in an existing repository, but I had created a whole different repo for playing around with.&#xA;Do I still have Netlify access? Yes, I can still login there via Github. I clicked around and went through a few things, my custom domain is still linked, I updated the node.</description>

      <description>This is a short review of my first foray into Advent of Code. I’ve started to gather my thoughts in the github readme while looking over the code again. I had big goals of completing each day in R and python, but after a few days decided that one language was more than enough. It will be an ongoing project to look at each day and see if I can write python solutions, while also collecting choice tidbits of fancy or useful or awful code.</description>

      <description>I’m a big fan of Run the Jewels, and remixes, and brass, and shortcodes, and this gets it exactly right.</description>
