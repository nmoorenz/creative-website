<p>This is a copy of my 2024 hot cross bun review thread from Facebook</p>
<div id="whittakers-hot-cross-bun-chocolate" class="section level4">
<h4>Whittaker’s Hot Cross Bun Chocolate</h4>
<p>Apparently I have a reputation: I’ve already had two of these blocks of Hot Cross Bun chocolate from Whittaker’s bought for me. It’s quite good at what it’s trying to do, with spice and orange and fruit, but it could never be better than berry and biscuit or Ghana peppermint. 7.5/10</p>
<p><img src="/img/fb24easter/whittakers.jpg" /></p>
</div>
<div id="woolworths-display" class="section level4">
<h4>Woolworths Display</h4>
<p>Woolworths branching out with different flavours: brioche, biscoff, caramilk, and of course chocolate. At $7 for 4 I’m not that keen but might give it a go if I see them again. They were only in stock for one trip that I saw, so maybe didn’t sell that well? 8/10 for concept</p>
<p><img src="/img/fb24easter/woolworths1.jpg" /></p>
</div>
<div id="woolworths-buns" class="section level4">
<h4>Woolworths Buns</h4>
<p>Woolworths aka Countdown. Pretty good, consistent over the years, even with a brand change. Pricier than they used to be. Delicious. 7/10 for consistency</p>
<p><img src="/img/fb24easter/woolworths2.jpg" /></p>
</div>
<div id="paknsave" class="section level4">
<h4>PaknSave</h4>
<p>PaknSave $4.49. Darker than Woolworths, and taste like it too. Maybe slightly more robust to be heated than Woolworths buns. 6/10 room for improvement</p>
<p><img src="/img/fb24easter/paknsave.jpg" /></p>
</div>
<div id="bakers-delight" class="section level4">
<h4>Baker’s Delight</h4>
<p>This Baker’s Delight offer on Instagram caught my attention so I signed up. It’s only now that I look back at the screenshot that I see the offer was only available for Feb. There’s another special offer in the app, so expect to see these in a future update. 10/10 for Baker’s Delight getting my details, 2/10 for me for follow through</p>
<p><img src="/img/fb24easter/bakersdelight.jpg" /></p>

<div id="bakers-delight-recipes" class="section level4">
<h4>Baker’s Delight Recipes</h4>
<p>Something else from Baker’s Delight: these bonkers recipes that somehow contain hot cross buns.<br />
<a href="https://bakersdelight.co.nz/recipes/" class="uri">https://bakersdelight.co.nz/recipes/</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Hot Cross Buns Waffles: Put a bun in a waffle machine to toast: good. Trying to pipe a cream cheese and apple mixture into the middle: very extra.<br />
</li>
<li>Hot Cross Bun-Misu: insane (but probably extremely delicious)<br />
</li>
<li>Hot Cross Buns Pie: I’m regretting that I don’t have a pie maker.<br />
</li>
<li>Hot Cross Buns Croquembouche: again, filling hot cross buns is so extra. How did someone think of this? Would definitely eat.<br />
</li>
<li>Choc Raspberry Hot Cross Bun Layer Cake: this is just putting sweetened cream in between hot cross buns. I love it.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="hazella" class="section level4">
<h4>Hazella</h4>
<p>Hazella from Whitakers. This is delicious. It rivals Ghana peppermint and dark salted caramel. Smooth roasted hazelnut flavour, that builds to a gentle intensity, perfectly balanced with the chocolate. 10/10 yum yum yum</p>
<p><img src="/img/fb24easter/hazella.jpg" /></p>
</div>
<div id="new-zealands-best" class="section level4">
<h4>New Zealand’s Best</h4>

</div>
<div id="janus-bakkerij" class="section level4">
<h4>Janus Bakkerij</h4>
<p>Janus Bakkerij from Wellington, because my sister thought correctly that it was a good idea to bring up some hot cross buns. This pack and the next review! My Nana stole one but I’ll forgive her.
These are very very good: lots of fruit, good spice and flavour, nice density and texture but soft too.
10/10 sister and I both agree, ideal hot cross buns</p>
<p><img src="/img/fb24easter/janus-bakkerij.jpg" /></p>
</div>
<div id="parsons-bakery" class="section level4">
<h4>Parson’s Bakery</h4>
<p>Parson’s from Wellington.
Not great, but not bad either. Not enough fruit, flavour was good, the crosses didn’t stick to the top when eating. Heavy without having a satisfying density.
6/10 give them a go if you’re in Khandallah</p>
<p><img src="/img/fb24easter/parsons.jpg" /></p>
</div>
<div id="daily-bread" class="section level4">
<h4>Daily Bread</h4>
<p>Daily Bread, $22 for 6.
Judged to be the best in NZ, but I don’t agree. They are great, nice and soft, juicy fruit, yummy orange glaze, good spice, but I think the Janus ones are better. They might technically be good with a sourdough recipe. Not quite enough spice and not quite the right texture.
9/10 would still eat all the time.</p>
<p><img src="/img/fb24easter/dailybread.jpg" /></p>
<p>Daily Bread has a cool store downtown near Britomart station. They have stacks of hot cross buns and I wanted to get a picture but also didn’t want to seem like a weirdo and there were people in the way (edit: it was really busy) so here’s the outside. Daily Bread is so cool they don’t have branding on their coffee cups. Large mocha, didn’t seem that large, not enough coffee and not enough chocolate but nice enough. Maybe I should start mocha reviews in central Auckland?</p>
<p><img src="/img/fb24easter/dailybread-store.jpg" /></p>
</div>
<div id="yarrows" class="section level4">
<h4>Yarrows</h4>
<p>Yarrows Traditional, $5.50 from New World
Pretty good, good fruit, good spice, good texture. 7/10 good buns</p>
<p><img src="/img/fb24easter/yarrows-spiced.jpg" /></p>
</div>
<div id="new-world-selection" class="section level4">
<h4>New World Selection</h4>
<p>New World + Yarrows selection
Spiced Fruitless (wouldn’t bother)
Mini Spiced Fruit (only a little smaller)
Spiced Fruit (got these ones)
Chocolate (probably good)</p>
<p><img src="/img/fb24easter/new-world1.jpg" /></p>
<p>New World Lunn Ave Yarrows speciality
Rocky Road (see above)
White Chocolate and Raspberry (probably good)
Cheese and Onion (sacrilege)</p>
<p><img src="/img/fb24easter/new-world2.jpg" /></p>
</div>
<div id="ima-cuisine" class="section level4">
<h4>Ima Cuisine</h4>
<p>Ima Cuisine, $6.50 for 1. Worth it.
Custard cross, ginger and orange pieces, currants not raisins, more cardamom than cinnamon I think, nearly enough for a lunch. 10/10 so good.
Crappy photo, sorry. Everyone in the place was eating one, there were many bags for collection, and they were still making more.</p>
<p><img src="/img/fb24easter/ima-cuisine.jpg" /></p>
</div>
<div id="yarrows-rocky-road" class="section level4">
<h4>Yarrows Rocky Road</h4>
<p>Yarrows Rocky Road, $6.19 from New World
See reply for other options.
These were like a hot cross bun version of a chocolate chip muffin, with a little bit of marshmallow added in. Nice enough, interesting to try, improved with 10 seconds in microwave.
6/10 not very rock and roll</p>
<p><img src="/img/fb24easter/yarrows-rockyroad.jpg" /></p>
</div>
<div id="moustache-cookies" class="section level4">
<h4>Moustache Cookies</h4>
<p>Moustache Caramilk Hot Cross Bun Cookie Pie.
Thanks to my lovely wife, she brought one of these home for me. Delicious, nice cinnamon and nutmeg, with a chunk of chocolate in the middle. Moustache cookies are great anyway.
9/10 thanks Dee</p>
<p><img src="/img/fb24easter/moustache.jpg" /></p>
</div>
<div id="grown-up-donuts" class="section level4">
<h4>Grown Up Donuts</h4>
<p>Grown Up Donuts Hot Cross Bun
A recommendation from my lovely wife, while I was running some errands at Sylvia Park. There were some other regular Boston Cream type ones with rabbit ears. This one was spiced filling with a simple cross on top. Raisins in the cream was very unnecessary. Great as a novelty but prefer others
7/10 yum</p>
<p><img src="/img/fb24easter/grownup.jpg" /></p>
</div>
<div id="homemade" class="section level4">
<h4>Homemade</h4>
<p>Made my own hot cross buns!
I had a few different recipes but chose a Jamie Oliver one. Prepared the dough the night before then in the morning incorporated the fruit, split them into buns, and baked. I think I either scalded the yeast or the rise in the fridge wasn’t very good because they were tough to work with and the fruit didn’t go in well and they didn’t have a good second rise. They tasted great so got the spice right.
10/10 from my mum, 6/10 from me</p>
