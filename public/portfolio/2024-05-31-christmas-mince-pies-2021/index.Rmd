Christmas mince pies, 2021.

Christmas mince pies, 2021.

**Countdown Salted Caramel Tarts**          
A twist on the regular. Quite nice, not at all traditional. Filling did not fill the case.        
Average 3/5

Didn't really fill the case after the top rose. Inadequate

Extra cases - I don't need 5, thanks though

**Countdown Plum and Gin**        
These are great. No gin taste but it is fun to pretend I'm having a tipple for morning tea. The plum is excellent. Something went on during baking, all the ones in the store were bubbled over as well.         
4/5 gotta look your best

**New World Xmas Mince Tarts**        
How good do these look? The ribbon ðŸŽ€ really makes these stand out. It's reusable as well with a little untie. Christmas wrapping totally sorted. Icing sugar sprinkled on top too which is a luxury. Good tarts, similar to others, which I do enjoy.       
5/5 gotta look your best

New World also have these in silver and gold, in case you're looking for some colour coordination for the Christmas table

**Edmonds Apricot and Cardamom Spiced Tarts**            
These were surprisingly good. Well presented in the usual Edmonds box. No foil case, so they must have a premium production line to get them out of the trays safely. Filling flavours were perfectly complimentary, pastry well baked.          
5/5 the score might be generous but worth your time

**Countdown Traditional FRUIT Mince Pies**        
New packaging, I think. They might have changed up the filling recipe slightly? There was a little more bite in the fruit.     
4/5 consistency is good

**Countdown Rum Infused Tarts**     
These are good. Similar to the gin ones, a little filling escaped during baking. Just a hint of rum spice with the traditional fruit mince. Has the price been reduced? Don't be scared folks.       
4/5 dealz

**Katie Moore Homemade Mince Pies**        
Sultanas, green apple, orange peel, brandy, no figs this year. Great by themselves or with ice cream.    
5/5 great to spend time with family at Christmas
