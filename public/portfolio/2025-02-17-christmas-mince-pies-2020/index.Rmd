## Countdown

Countdown Fruit Mince Pies

A classic, but kinda basic. The tin foil seems unnecessary, just cook them in a muffin pan. (How big do commercial muffin pans get or do they just have lots of them?) 3/5 good in a pinch but not top shelf

## Homemade 1

Homemade by my niece. Pastry and filling shop bought, but expertly put together as a practice before Christmas Day. More currants and spice than other pies which is good. Baked well, eaten hot, delicious. 4/5 looking forward to round 2

## Free Stuff

Free mince pie as part of a corporate thank you for IT from Spark at work. Fruit mince was really minced, smooth, different but ok. Case was nice. 3/5 tastes like free stuff

## Homemade 2

Homemade from scratch by my sister. Sultanas, figs, cranberries, apple, orange and lemon zest, mixed peel, brandy and butter. Delicious. Can taste the different fruit. 7/5 perfect score now I've got 2 people making pies.

## Homemade 3

(catching up on a few pies)

Farewell morning tea homemade. Pretty good, thick pastry, standard mince, 3/5 tastes like goodbye

## Two Tarts

Two Tarts brandy flavour from Parnell farmers' market. They also had original and Cointreau. Didn't really taste the brandy, but still good. Two bites and done. 3/5 prefer the potato farl we also got from the markets

## Pams

Pam's fruit mince tarts. Standard pattern for fruit mince pies apparently, as evidenced by countdown and Ernest Adams (up next) and some others I've seen. Maybe a little less butter than Ernest Adams, but very similar. 3/5 reasonable

Ernest Adams Christmas Delights

Festive Rich Fruit Christmas Tarts

Bold packaging can't save these tarts from same-same mediocrity. 3/5 maybe I should make my own or maybe I should not post all at once
