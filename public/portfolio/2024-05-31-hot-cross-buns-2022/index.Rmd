This is a copy of my 2022 facebook thread on hot cross buns   

**Countdown Chocolate Orange**       
These folks have a whole range out now which reminded me to post. These were released first I think since I haven't seen the others. Countdown knows where to direct their advertising. Quite good, like a bun of jaffas? Maybe a bit generic? $6.50 for countdown half dozen?       
3/5 room for improvement

**Yarrows The Bakers**
Apple and Cinnamon Buns      
"Soft sweet buns with juicy apple pieces and sweetly spiced cinnamon". Delicious, worth a second purchase to confirm that they are delicious.         
4/5 the best a man can get

Sam seems like a good person

I'm glad I'm not mistaken with countdown hot cross buns.

**Countdown**, the usual, quite good, balanced, crisp up well under the grill.        
3.5/5 reliable

**Bakers Delight**, half dozen for $10.         
These are large and dense soft, and crisp up well on the oven on the third day. We left the butter out overnight and it was worth it.       
4.5/5 scrumptious

**Cookie Time**        
My only beef with these is that they say "rustic" as if breaking apart some biscuits and chocolate instead of nicely cutting is a selling point. Otherwise: delicious, moreish, chocolatey, extravagant.            
I'm a sucker for marketing crossover, I even liked the Kit Kat Whitakers chocolate, so the best cookies with the best buns is an obvious yes          
5/5 ate 3 in one day and wanted more
