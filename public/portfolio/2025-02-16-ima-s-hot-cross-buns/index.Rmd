*During lockdown in 2020, Ima's Cuisine offered make-at-home kits for their famous hot cross buns. I got some delivered to my in-laws, who were within the delivery radius. I then did a contactless pickup from outside their garage where the package had been left. This is the thread documenting their creation.*
