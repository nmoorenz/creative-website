## Yarrows

Yarrows The Bakers\
Spiced Fruit Easter Buns\
Surprisingly weird name even though it makes total sense. They come with instructions on heating: 3-5 mins at 180C. Delicious, toasty, crunchy, fruity.\
4/5 looking forward to more buns

## Ima [homemade]

Ima Cuisine, \$40 for 12 plus a couple hours of mixing and kneading and rising and baking. Delicious and so satisfying that I made them. 7/5 perfect score would make again
