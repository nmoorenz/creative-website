Christmas Mince Pies 2018

<!--more-->

## Countdown

I'm sure these are good, but they are probably the same as last year

## Apricot

Apricot, looks like the filling bubbled over during cooking, sticky around the edges. Tasty enough. Not very apricoty, just fruity sweet. Good start, needs work. 2/5 would eat again

## Ernest Adams

Ernest Adams Christmas Delights. Fancy box packaging, looks nice, assuming the same as last year. Unpurchased, would purchase again.

## Countdown

New! Fruit mince from countdown. Very nice with a cup of tea while watching the Late Late Toy Show. <https://www.rte.ie/entertainment/2018/1130/1014476-the-best-moments-of-the-toy-show-so-far/> \
Toy Show 5/5 Scott is the real hero \
Pies 3/5 good crust good mince

## Pam's Finest

Pam's Finest\
Butter Crust Dark Cocoa Christmas Treats\
Traditional Brandied Fruit Mince in Short Butter Pastry Enhanced with Rich Cocoa\
Small, nearly bite size, good mince, well balanced with the crust, but not enticing. Would eat again, wouldn't rave about them.\
BBQ brisket and cornbread much preferable, available on demand.

## Mystery

Mystery pie from work treats, with icing sugar. Hatches and foil suggest countdown. Crust and fruit adequate. Good addition with the icing sugar. 3/5 would steal from another department again.

## Farro

Farro Traditional Mince Tarts. Given to me by someone at work who is gluten free and wanted me to review.\
Small, fruit is ok, good crust, but probably too much crust. Not the best, 2/5, would accept as a gift again.

## PaknSave

PaknSave Cake Special Order\
These are my favourite for this year! Standard crust with the now familiar criss cross pattern. Fruit is what makes it, just the right amount of spice. Good on its own, or warmed in the microwave with cream on top. 4/5 would have two in one sitting again.
