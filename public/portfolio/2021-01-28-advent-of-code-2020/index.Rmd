This is a short review of my first foray into Advent of Code. 

<!--more-->

This is a short review of my first foray into Advent of Code. I've started to gather my thoughts in the github readme while looking over the code again. I had big goals of completing each day in R and python, but after a few days decided that one language was more than enough. It will be an ongoing project to look at each day and see if I can write python solutions, while also collecting choice tidbits of fancy or useful or awful code. 

This is the advent website: [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020)

This is my github repository: [github.com/nmoorenz/advent-of-code](https://github.com/nmoorenz/advent-of-code)

The following is a comparison of R and Python code for day 5, my favourite day of the challenge. Recognising the ticket numbers can be interpreted in binary is a crucial breakthrough. I love finding a new and good function in R: `strtoi()`. That takes a `base` argument for binary! Then finding `int()` in Python has the same argument. List comprehensions are, for me, a killer feature of Python. 

### R Code

```{r advent1, echo = TRUE}
# tidyverse of course
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))

# love the here package to load things
inputfile = here::here("static", "data", "advent2020", "day05.txt")
bp <- read.delim(inputfile, header = FALSE)

# conversions for letters to binary
named_v = c("F" = "0", "B" = "1", "L" = "0", "R" = "1")

# mutate seems like the best way to do this
# we can also use many replacements in one function
# strtoi() for string to integer, in base 2
bp_bin <- bp %>% 
  mutate(
    bin = str_replace_all(V1, named_v),
    row = strtoi(str_sub(bin, end = 7), base = 2), 
    col = strtoi(str_sub(bin, start = 8), base = 2), 
    id = row * 8 + col
  )

# max is part one answer
max_id <- max(bp_bin$id)  
min_id <- min(bp_bin$id)

# possible seats from min to max
bp_seq = seq(from = min_id, to = max_id)

# part two answer - seat left over
p2 <- setdiff(bp_seq, bp_bin$id)
```

### Python Code

```{python advent2, echo = TRUE}
# read file
with open("../../../static/data/advent2020/day05.txt", "r") as f:
  bp = f.read().splitlines()

# row and col binary via replacement
row = [x[:7].replace("B", "1").replace("F", "0") for x in bp]
col = [x[7:].replace("L", "0").replace("R", "1") for x in bp]

# id as a combo of row and col            
id = [int(r, 2) * 8 + int(c, 2) for r, c in zip(row, col)]

#part a
p1 = max(id)

# part b
p2 = set(range(min(id), max(id))) - set(id)
```

### Answer 

The maximum seat number on my plane (part one answer) is `r max_id` and my seat number (part two answer) is `r p2`. 

In honour of the card playing crab mentioned in the challenges, here's a big one from the Te Papa collection, only included here for creating a picture for the blog page.
